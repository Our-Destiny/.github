## About

**Our Destiny Research & Development Labs (ODRDLabs) is a startup from Kerala - India, in its early phase. The first baby steps taken by the founders were back in July 2013, beginning with Project JARVIS. The inspiration from this little project led the founders to the creation & evolution of Project Our Destiny in 2019. The team started with two and now crossed the strength of 10+ contributors. The well-disciplined and consistent team is guided and mentored efficiently by [Mr. Shahad. P](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahad-p-b45b4b1b1/) (Asst.Professor, Dept.of Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, Madanapalle Institute Of Technology & Science)**

Artificial intelligence holds great opportunity for humanity, encompassing everything from Google’s algorithms to self-driving cars to facial recognition software. The AI we have today, however, is still in its primitive stages. Experts worry about what will happen when that intelligence outpaces us. Or, as **Hawking puts it, “Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.”**

> ***"The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded."*** - Stephen Hawking (From an interview with the BBC, December 2014)

This might sound like the stuff of science fiction, but Hawking says dismissing it as such **“would be a mistake, and potentially our worst mistake ever.”** <br />
    
Compared to robots, we humans are pretty clunky. Limited by the slow pace of evolution, it takes us generations to iterate. Robots, on the other hand, can improve upon their own design a lot faster, and soon, they’ll probably be able to do so without our help. Hawking says this will create an **“intelligence explosion”** in which machines could exceed our intelligence **“by more than ours exceeds that of snails.”** <br />
    
A lot of people think that the threat of AI centers on it becoming malevolent rather than benevolent. Hawking disabuses us of this concern, saying that

> **“The real risk with AI isn’t malice but competence. A superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble.”** <br />
> **“You’re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green-energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. Let’s not place humanity in the position of those ants,”** Hawking writes. <br />

<a href="no"><img width="100%" height="auto" src="https://github.com/Our-Destiny/.github/blob/main/profile/assets/RougeRobot.png" height="175px"/></a>

For those still unpersuaded, he suggests a different metaphor. ***“Why are we so worried about AI? Surely humans are always able to pull the plug?”*** a hypothetical person asks him.
Hawking answers: ***“People asked a computer, ‘Is there a God?’ And the computer said, ‘There is now,’ and fused the plug.”***

> ***The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks, combined with the availability of data and processing power, has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, machine translation, legged locomotion, and question-answering systems.*** <br />
    <br />
    ***As capabilities in these areas and others cross the threshold from laboratory research to economically valuable technologies, a virtuous cycle takes hold whereby even small improvements in performance are worth large sums of money, prompting greater investments in research. There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that its impact on society is likely to increase…. Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.*** - From Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence, an open letter co-signed by Hawking, January 2015.

<a href="#"><img width="100%" height="auto" src="https://github.com/Our-Destiny/.github/blob/main/profile/assets/NuclearConfrontation.png" height="175px"/></a>

If it’s not the robots, it is ***“almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years,”*** Hawking writes. <br />

<a href="#"><img width="100%" height="auto" src="https://github.com/Our-Destiny/.github/blob/main/profile/assets/NaturalCatastrophe.png" height="175px"/></a>

In fact, we might not have a future at all, he says, warning us not to put all our eggs ***“in one basket.”*** And yes, that basket is planet Earth. Even if humans figure out a way escape, ***“the millions of species that inhabit the Earth”*** will be doomed, he says. ***“And that will be on our conscience as a race.”*** <br />
    
Another warning isn’t any less menacing. We are entering a new phase of ***“self-designed evolution.”*** This stage means we will soon be able to cast off the chains of traditional evolution and start changing and improving our own DNA now — not in hundreds of thousands of years. <br />
    
As with AI, the ability to edit our own DNA holds the potential to fix humanity’s greatest problems. First, and likely not in the distant future, we’ll be able to repair genetic defects, editing out genes for things like muscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, the disease he was diagnosed with in 1963. Hawking says that within this century, we’ll be able to edit intelligence, memory, and length of life. And that’s when things could get really complicated. <br />

<a href="#vision"><img width="100%" height="auto" src="https://github.com/Our-Destiny/.github/blob/main/profile/assets/Suphumans.png" height="175px"/></a>

Hawking calls the people who will do this **“superhumans,”** and they’re likely to be the world’s wealthy elites. Regular old humans won’t be able to compete, and will probably **“die out, or become unimportant.”** At the same time, superhumans will likely be **“colonizing other planets and stars.”** <br />

If that all sounds pretty depressing, it is. But even as Hawking serves up an apocalyptic prognosis for the planet and everyone on it, his brand of optimism comes through. He has faith that **“our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will therefore survive the disaster.”** <br />

He even believes that, instead of being terrifying, these possibilities are thrilling and that it **“greatly increases the chances of inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever she might be.”** <br />

***Figuring out a way off of planet Earth, and maybe even the solar system, is an opportunity to do what the moon landings did: “elevate humanity, bring people and nations together, usher in new discoveries and new technologies.”*** <br />

## Milestones


- [x] **Isolation-based Security to Prevent and Enhance Incident Response for Personal Assistance Systems. [Phase I]** :shield:<details><summary>Know more</summary><p><br />
    **Problem Statement :** <br />
    <sub>The vast majority of IoT threats are mundane and low-risk, but there are a few high-impact threats that could cause serious damage. The possibility of hackers accessing sensitive information stored on IoT devices is one serious threat. This could include personal information (such as names, addresses, and passwords), financial information (such as bank account numbers and credit card numbers), or even sensitive military information (such as troop movements and strategic plans). Another high-impact threat is the potential for rogue devices to be installed on corporate networks or government institutions. These devices might be used to break into some other systems and steal confidential information. Finally, IoT devices can be exploited by hackers to launch cyberattacks on other systems. This could include accessing private information, stealing money or data, or attacking critical infrastructure systems. **[In a nutshell perception. For more details please go through our research paper.]** </sub><br />
    <br />
    **Our Proposed Solution :** <br /><sub> 
     - Design an isolated system capable of running completely offline (Without Internet).</sub>
    </p></details>
    




- [x] **A rule based PA(Personal Assistance System).**<details><summary>Know more</summary><p><br />
    **What is a Rule-Based System?** <br />
    <sub>A rule-based system is a system that applies human-made rules to store, sort and manipulate data. In doing so, it mimics human intelligence. 
        Rule-based systems require a set of facts or source of data, and a set of rules for manipulating that data. These rules are sometimes referred to as ‘If statements’ as they tend to follow the line of ‘IF X happens THEN do Y’.  **[In a nutshell perception. For more details please go through our research paper.]** </sub><br />
    <br />
    
    **What are the characteristics of rule-based systems?** <br /><sub> 
    - <sub>They are made up of the combined knowledge of human experts in the problem domain.</sub>
    - <sub>They represent knowledge in a very declarative manner.</sub>
    - <sub>They make it possible to use various knowledge representations paradigms.</sub>
    - <sub>They support the implementation of non-deterministic search and control strategies.</sub>
    - <sub>They help in describing fragmentary, ill-structured, heuristic, judgemental knowledge.</sub>
    - <sub>They are robust and have the ability to operate using uncertain or incomplete knowledge.</sub>
    - <sub>They can help with rule based decision making.</sub>
    <br />
    
    **How does a rule based system in AI work?** <br />
    <sub>Rule-based systems outlines triggers & the actions that should follow (or are triggered). For example, a trigger might be an email containing the word “invoice”. An action might then be to forward the email to the finance team.
        These rules most often take the form of "if" statements. "IF" outlines the trigger, "THEN" specifies the action to complete. So, if you want to create a rule-based system capable of handling 100 different actions, you’d have to write 100 different rules. If you want to then update the system and add actions, then you would need to write new rules.
        In short, you use rules to tell a machine what to do, and the machine will do exactly as you tell it. From there, rule-based systems will execute the actions until you tell it to stop.
        But remember: if you tell it to do something incorrectly, it will do it incorrectly.  **[In a nutshell perception. For more details please go through our research paper.]** </sub><br />
    <br />
    **What we have created?** <br />
    <sub>We have designed a rule-based PA system using NLTK (an NLP Tool kit) capable of recognizing user commands and replying like a chatbot. Our design is not just a chatbot but a chat engine capable of executing tasks from user conversations. This PA system uses a complicated decision engine called the Neural Scheme created by mimicking human decision-making. **[In a nutshell perception. For more details please go through our research paper.]** </sub><br />

- [x] **Automating Operating Systems.**<details><summary>Know more</summary><p><br />
    **What is Automation and Automating an Operating System?**<br />
    <sub>Automation is the use of technology to accomplish a task with as little human interaction as possible. In computing, automation is usually accomplished by a program, a script, or batch processing. Here, Automating the Operating System is to achieve user-controlled actions to be made fully automatic with the help of speech recognition or autonomy.</sub><br />
    <br />
    **What are the automations that we have implemented here by far?** <br /><sub> 
    - <sub>Basic File & Folder access control and thier advanced operations</sub>
    - <sub>Media Control</sub>
    - <sub>System Control & Navigation</sub>
    - <sub>Browser Automation</sub>
    - <sub>Application Control Automation</sub><br />
    <br />
    
    **Platforms Tested by far :** <br />
    - <sub>Windows</sub>
    - <sub>Ubuntu</sub>
    - <sub>Kali Linux</sub>
    - <sub>Android</sub>
    - <sub>Arch Linux</sub>
    </p></details>







- [x] **Offline Speech Recognition & Text-To-Speech.**<details><summary>Know more</summary><p><br />
    **What is Speech Recognition (or) Speech-To-Text?**<br />
    <sub>Speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is the ability of a machine or program to identify words spoken aloud and convert them into readable text. Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary and may only identify words and phrases when spoken clearly. More sophisticated software can handle natural speech, different accents and various languages. Speech recognition uses a broad array of research in computer science, linguistics and computer engineering. Many modern devices and text-focused programs have speech recognition functions in them to allow for easier or hands-free use of a device. ***Offline speech recognition is a voice recognition system with the ability to recognize the voice and deliver data from it. The system works offline meaning you do not need an internet connection to use it.***</sub><br />
    <br />
    **What is Text-To-Speech?**<br />
    <sub>Text-to-Speech (also known as TTS, speech or voice synthesis) produces voices from text as its name would suggest. This technology relies on the creation of voice engines able to translate graphemes (small text data) into phonemes (small audio data). In order to sound like a human voice, machine learning is used to find the evaluate and choose the most appropriate way to pronounce words and sentences. With the addition of SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language), customization can go far beyond that (pitch, timbre, level, speed…).</sub><br />
    <br />
    **What is the need of Offline Speech-To-Text & Text-To-Speech for us here?**<br />
    <sub>In this Autonomous A.A.I(Augmented Artificial Intelligence) program, we use Offline Speech-To-Text engine as an ASR(Automated Speech Recognition) engine that acts as input for Destiny. The user input after processing is generated with certain responses that are to be spoken. We use Offline Text-To-Speech as an engine for speech output.</sub><br />
    <br />
    </p></details>

- [x] **Computer Vision For Automation.**<details><summary>Know more</summary><p><br />
    **What is Computer Vision?**<br />
    <sub>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand. <br />Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.<br /> Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. Because a system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze thousands of products or processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can quickly surpass human capabilities. Computer vision is used in industries ranging from energy and utilities to manufacturing and automotive – and the market is continuing to grow</sub><br />
    <br />
    **What is Automation using Computer Vision?**<br />
    <sub>Defined as the combination of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent automation can process unstructured and semi-structured data to automate end-to-end business processes and learn to increasingly improve performance as more data is fed into it.</sub><br />
    <br />
    **What we have forged using this technology?**<br />
    <sub>We have created an advanced and intelligent automation extension for Destiny capable of utilizing Open-CV as its own eyes to look across the monitor to extract more sophisticated data & gives a flexible opportunity for enhancing Destiny's system automation functions.</sub><br />
